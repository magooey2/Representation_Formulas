# Representation_Formulas
Use linear regression to recreate formulas for the number of representation of some quadratic forms.

  The file that starts with 'table' contains computed values, while the one that starts with 'lin_reg' has the code to produce the linear regression.  The output from the linear regression is in the file with initial portion 'OLS'.
